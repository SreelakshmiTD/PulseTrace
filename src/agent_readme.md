# Agents Module (Placeholder)

This directory represents the agent components of PulseTrace:
- `pulse_detector`
- `root_cause_diagnoser`
- `pattern_history_agent`
- `impact_scope_agent`
- `pulse_advisor`

In the competition implementation, all agent logic is contained inside  
`notebooks/PulseTrace_capstone.ipynb` for easier execution in Kaggle.

These folders serve as architectural placeholders to show how PulseTrace  
would be structured as a production library.
