# Utilities Module (Placeholder)

This directory would contain helper utilities for:
- formatting outputs
- shared constants
- file operations
- parsing logs
- generating visualizations

Utility functions are currently implemented inline inside the Kaggle notebook.

This module acts as part of the standard project layout for clarity and organization.
